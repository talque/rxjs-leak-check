            Here you can see a list of active subscriptions to
            observables. Many of these are not leaks but required for
            the correct working of your program. To check your program
            for leaks, you should

                Open the page that contains the code you want to
                check, to initialize any subscriptions once. If you
                want to check a particular action (e.g. click on a
                button) then perform that action now.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Then open this page. You'll see many subscriptions,
                almost none from your code. Click
                the <mat-icon class="icon">delete_outline</mat-icon>
                button to hide these until the next reload.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Go back to the page that contains the code you want to
                check. If you want to check a particular action
                (e.g. click on a button) then perform that action
                again. Any subscriptions that you create now are
                potential memory leaks, unless they are unsubscribed
                when you leave.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Open this page for the second time. Any new
                subscriptions are either leaks from your code, or
                internally created by framework code. If you select
                <span class="italic">Interesting subscriptions</span>
                then anything
                from <span class="italic">node_modules</span> is
                filtered out, and only leaks from your code should
                remain.
